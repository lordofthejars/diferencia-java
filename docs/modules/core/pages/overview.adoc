= Diferencia Java Core
include::_attributes.adoc[]

*Core* module is a framework-less module which implements all logic to deal with Diferencia.

You can think about this module as the base module that all Java implementations might use to integrate Diferencia with Java.
Of course, it can be used standalone directly in your Java code, but the idea is to be used by frameworks that want to implement support for Diferencia.
