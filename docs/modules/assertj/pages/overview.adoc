= Diferencia AssertJ Assertions
include::_attributes.adoc[]


http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/[Assertj] module offers a custom AssertJ assertion to validate that no errors between _primaries_ and _candidates_ (in case of noise detection, _secondaries_ as well) have occurred.
In this way, you don't need to validate the error code of each interaction, you just need to execute all interactions and finally check that Diferencia has no errors.
